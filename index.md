Welcome to the **WWL Frontier Hack Event**!  

This Hack Event  is about exploring how AI can help us tackle real challenges at work.  

You’ll collaborate with your team to define a problem, brainstorm solutions, and craft a solution — with the help of your Table Coach and AI.  

> **Goal:** Accelerate alignment on the Frontier Firm concept and generate problem statements and solution ideas that could one day inform agent development. This exercise is about the process — framing challenges, collaborating, and ideating together — not about delivering a finished agent.
